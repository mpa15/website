            "abstract": "Pediatric patients with intractable epilepsy represent a challenging clinical population. However, recent advances in neuroimaging with a multimodality imaging approach that combines fluorine 18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography, magnetoencephalography, diffusion tensor imaging, and magnetic source imaging with conventional magnetic resonance imaging continue to improve diagnosis and treatment in affected patients. These advances are increasing the understanding of the underlying disease process and improving the ability to noninvasively detect epileptogenic foci that in the past went undetected and whose accurate localization is crucial for a good outcome following surgical resection.© RSNA, 2008",

            "abstract": "AbstractStructural magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) is of fundamental importance to the diagnosis and treatment of epilepsy, particularly when surgery is being considered. Despite previous recommendations and guidelines, practices for the use of MRI are variable worldwide and may not harness the full potential of recent technological advances for the benefit of people with epilepsy. The International League Against Epilepsy Diagnostic Methods Commission has thus charged the 2013‐2017 Neuroimaging Task Force to develop a set of recommendations addressing the following questions: (1) Who should have an MRI ? (2) What are the minimum requirements for an MRI epilepsy protocol? (3) How should magnetic resonance (MR) images be evaluated? (4) How to optimize lesion detection? These recommendations target clinicians in established epilepsy centers and neurologists in general/district hospitals. They endorse routine structural imaging in new onset generalized and focal epilepsy alike and describe the range of situations when detailed assessment is indicated. The Neuroimaging Task Force identified a set of sequences, with three‐dimensional acquisitions at its core, the harmonized neuroimaging of epilepsy structural sequences— HARNESS ‐ MRI protocol. As these sequences are available on most MR scanners, the HARNESS ‐ MRI protocol is generalizable, regardless of the clinical setting and country. The Neuroimaging Task Force also endorses the use of computer‐aided image postprocessing methods to provide an objective account of an individual’s brain anatomy and pathology. By discussing the breadth and depth of scope of MRI , this report emphasizes the unique role of this noninvasive investigation in the care of people with epilepsy.",

            "abstract": "Ongoing challenges in diagnosing focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) mandate continuous research and consensus agreement to improve disease definition and classification. An International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) Task Force (TF) reviewed the FCD classification of 2011 to identify existing gaps and provide a timely update. The following methodology was applied to achieve this goal: a survey of published literature indexed with ((Focal Cortical Dysplasia) AND (epilepsy)) between 01/01/2012 and 06/30/2021 (n = 1349) in PubMed identified the knowledge gained since 2012 and new developments in the field. An online survey consulted the ILAE community about the current use of the FCD classification scheme with 367 people answering. The TF performed an iterative clinico-pathological and genetic agreement study to objectively measure the diagnostic gap in blood/brain samples from 22 patients suspicious for FCD and submitted to epilepsy surgery. The literature confirmed new molecular-genetic characterizations involving the mechanistic Target Of Rapamycin (mTOR) pathway in FCD type II (FCDII), and SLC35A2 in mild malformations of cortical development (mMCDs) with oligodendroglial hyperplasia (MOGHE). The electro-clinical-imaging phenotypes and surgical outcomes were better defined and validated for FCDII. Little new information was acquired on clinical, histopathological, or genetic characteristics of FCD type I (FCDI) and FCD type III (FCDIII). The survey identified mMCDs, FCDI, and genetic characterization as fields for improvement in an updated classification. Our iterative clinico-pathological and genetic agreement study confirmed the importance of immunohistochemical staining, neuroimaging, and genetic tests to improve the diagnostic yield. The TF proposes to include mMCDs, MOGHE, and “no definite FCD on histopathology” as new categories in the updated FCD classification. The histopathological classification can be further augmented by advanced neuroimaging and genetic studies to comprehensively diagnose FCD subtypes; these different levels should then be integrated into a multi-layered diagnostic scheme. This update may help to foster multidisciplinary efforts toward a better understanding of FCD and the development of novel targeted treatment options.",

            "abstract": "The International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) Subcommittee for Pediatric Neuroimaging examined the usefulness of, and indications for, neuroimaging in the evaluation of children with newly diagnosed epilepsy. The retrospective and prospective published series with n ≥30 utilizing computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (1.5 T) that evaluated children with new-onset seizure(s) were reviewed. Nearly 50% of individual imaging studies in children with localization-related new-onset seizure(s) were reported to be abnormal; 15–20% of imaging studies provided useful information on etiology or and seizure focus, and 2–4% provided information that potentially altered immediate medical management. A significant imaging abnormality in the absence of a history of a localization-related seizure, abnormal neurologic examination, or focal electroencephalography (EEG) is rare. Imaging studies in childhood absence epilepsy, juvenile absence epilepsy, juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, and benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (BECTS) do not identify significant structural abnormalities. Imaging provides important contributions to establishing etiology, providing prognostic information, and directing treatment in children with recently diagnosed epilepsy. Imaging is recommended when localization-related epilepsy is known or suspected, when the epilepsy classification is in doubt, or when an epilepsy syndrome with remote symptomatic cause is suspected. When available, MRI is preferred to CT because of its superior resolution, versatility, and lack of radiation.",

            "abstract": "Purpose: To determine the yield of emergent neuroimaging among children with new-onset seizures presenting with status epilepticus. Method: We performed a cross-sectional study of children seen at a single ED between 1995 and 2012 with new-onset seizure presenting with status epilepticus. We deﬁned status epilepticus as a single seizure or multiple seizures without regaining consciousness lasting 30 min or longer. Our primary outcome was urgent or emergent intracranial pathology identiﬁed on neuroimaging. We categorized neuroimaging results as emergent if they would have changed acute management as assessed by a blinded neuroradiologist and neurologist. To ensure abnormalities were not missed, we review neuroimaging results for 30 days following the initial episode of SE. Results: We included 177 children presenting with new-onset seizure with status epilepticus, of whom 170 (96%) had neuroimaging performed. Abnormal ﬁndings were identiﬁed on neuroimaging in 64/177 (36%, 95% conﬁdence interval 29–43%) children with 15 (8.5%, 95% conﬁdence interval 5.2–14%) children having urgent or emergent pathology. Four (27%) of the 15 children with urgent or emergent ﬁndings had a normal non-contrast computed tomography scan and a subsequently abnormal magnetic resonance image. Longer seizure duration and older age were associated with urgent or emergent intracranial pathology. Conclusion: A substantial minority of children with new-onset seizures presenting with status epilepticus have urgent or emergent intracranial pathology identiﬁed on neuroimaging. Clinicians should strongly consider emergent neuroimaging in these children. Magnetic resonance imaging is the preferred imaging modality when available and safe.",

            "abstract": "Focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) is a common cause of pharmacoresistant epilepsy that is amenable to surgical resective treatment. The identification of structural FCD by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can contribute to the detection of the epileptogenic zone and improve the outcome of epilepsy surgery. MR epilepsy protocols that include specific T1 and T2 weighted, and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequences give complementary information about the characteristic imaging features of FCD; focal cortical thickening, blurring of the gray-white junction, high FLAIR signal, and gyral anatomical abnormalities. Novel imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), magnetization transfer imaging (MTI), and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) can improve the sensitivity of MR to localize the anatomical lesion. Functional/metabolic techniques such as positron emission tomography (PET), ictal subtraction single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), functional MRI (fMRI), and magnetic source imaging (MSI) have the potential to visualize the metabolic, vascular, and epileptogenic properties of the FCD lesion, respectively. Identification of eloquent areas of cortex, to assist in the surgical resection plan, can be obtained non-invasively through the use of fMRI and MSI. Although a significant number of FCD lesions remain unidentified using current neuroimaging techniques, future advances should result in the identification of an increasing number of these cortical malformations.",

With over 100 distinguished contributors from world-leading epilepsy programs, the long-awaited new edition maintains the breadth and scope the book is known for while significantly updating the science, practice, and therapeutic strategies that continue to move the field forward. At the center of this new edition is the totally reorganized and expanded section on age-related syndromes. There is a major emphasis on new genetic-based classifications and the clinical implications for identifying and managing the various subtypes. New chapters devoted exclusively to Panayiotopoulos syndrome, myoclonic status epilepticus, and autosomal dominant focal epilepsies, among others, cover even more ground than the last edition. Brand-new chapters in the drug and diet section cover perampanel, ezogabine, and lacosamide, while the existing chapters on major medical treatments have been comprehensively updated to reflect the latest trials and studies. Other sections contain new chapters on genetics, non-invasive functional mapping, sleep issues for pediatric epilepsy patients, and more. With more than 80 chapters, Pellock’s Pediatric Epilepsy now contains a full discussion of the spectrum of epilepsy disorders, not just seizures. From basic mechanisms and epidemiology, through diagnosis and therapy, to quality of life issues, the new edition of this established reference covers every aspect of childhood epilepsy and will continue to be the definitive core text for all professionals involved in the field. New to the Fourth Edition: Every chapter thoroughly reviewed, revised, and updated Section on age-related syndromes completely reconfigured to align with new ILAE terminology and organization in classifying seizures and forms of epilepsy Major update on disease mechanisms and all treatments for epilepsy, including drugs Increased attention to special populations, including a heavily-updated chapter on the female epilepsy patient New final section covers the epilepsy spectrum, with new chapters on epilepsy and sleep, co-morbidities of childhood, behavioral influence of AEDs, and transitioning to adulthood",

            "abstract": "Neuroimaging is generally considered a part of the evaluation of seizures and epilepsy. There is limited information about its current use in the initial evaluation of pediatric epilepsy and about its yield during the initial diagnosis of epilepsy. We describe the patterns in the use and yield of diagnostic imaging in children with newly diagnosed epilepsy in a community-based study.Children were recruited when first diagnosed with epilepsy by participating physicians in Connecticut (1993–1997). Definitions for etiology and underlying epilepsy syndromes are as published by the International League Against Epilepsy.Of 613 children, 488 (79.6%) had imaging: 388 (63.3%) magnetic resonance imaging, 197 (32.1%) computed tomography scans, and 97 (15.8%) both. Half of children with idiopathic generalized epilepsy had imaging studies compared with 70% to 100% of children with other forms of epilepsy, depending on the specific type. Etiologically relevant abnormalities were found in 62 (12.7% of those imaged). Fourteen of these children had otherwise completely normal presentations and histories. Their abnormalities included tuberous sclerosis (N = 4), tumors (N = 2), an arteriovenous malformation later diagnosed as a tumor, a cavernous angioma, cerebral malformations (N = 3), and other abnormalities (N = 3). Thirteen of the 14 had partial seizures and 12 had focal electroencephalographic (EEG) findings. Only 1 had neither.In children with newly diagnosed epilepsy, neuroimaging reveals a small but significant number of serious abnormalities not previously suspected. Most of these children have partial seizures or focal EEG abnormalities. Neuroimaging should be considered during the evaluation of children with newly diagnosed epilepsy, especially for those with neurologic deficits or partial seizures or focal EEG abnormalities that are not part of an idiopathic localization-related epilepsy syndrome.",

The data were analyzed to assess the proportion of children who underwent neuroimaging, the type of neuroimaging, and abnormalities.Of 725 children (93.5%) with neuroimaging, 714 had an MRI (87% with seizure protocols) and 11 had computed tomography or ultrasound only. Etiologically relevant abnormalities were present in 290 individuals (40%) and included: an acquired injury in 97 (13.4%), malformations of cortical development in 56 (7.7%), and other diffuse disorders of brain development in 51 (7.0%). Neuroimaging was abnormal in 160 of 262 (61%) children with abnormal development at diagnosis versus 113 of 463 (24%) children with typical development. Neuroimaging abnormalities were most common in association with focal seizure semiology (40%), spasms (47%), or unclear semiology (42%). In children without spasms or focal semiology with typical development, 29 of 185 (16%) had imaging abnormalities. Pathogenic genetic variants were identified in 53 of 121 (44%) children with abnormal neuroimaging in whom genetic testing was performed.Structural abnormalities occur commonly in ELE, and adherence to neuroimaging guidelines is high at US pediatric epilepsy centers. These data support the universal adoption of imaging guidelines because the yield is substantially high, even in the lowest risk group.",

            "abstract": "The etiology of epilepsy is variable and sometimes multifactorial. Clinical course and response to treatment largely depend on the precise etiology of the seizures. Along with the electroencephalogram (EEG), neuroimaging techniques, in particular, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), are the most important tools for determining the possible etiology of epilepsy. Over the last few years, there have been many developments in data acquisition and analysis for both morphological and functional neuroimaging of people suffering from this condition. These innovations have increased the detection of underlying structural pathologies, which have till recently been classified as “cryptogenic” epilepsy. Cryptogenic epilepsy is often refractory to anti-epileptic drug treatment. In drug-resistant patients with structural or consistent functional lesions related to the epilepsy syndrome, surgery is the only treatment that can offer a seizure-free outcome. The pre-operative detection of the underlying structural condition increases the odds of successful surgical treatment of pharmacoresistant epilepsy. This article provides a comprehensive overview of neuroimaging techniques in epilepsy, highlighting recent advances and innovations and summarizes frequent etiologies of epilepsy in order to improve the diagnosis and management of patients suffering from seizures, especially young patients and children.",

A change to the structure or biochemical makeup of our brains can affect our mental health, the way we cope with the normal stresses of life, our productivity, and our overall well-being. Scientists interested in studying the brain and mental health disorders (called neuroscientists) seek to understand how the architecture and biochemical makeup of the brain differs in health and disease. To do this, we use a technique called magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to image inside the living brain, to examine its function and structure.

            "abstract": "Hemimegalencephaly is a rare hamartomatous malformation of the brain, remarkable for its extreme asymmetry. It can be isolated or associated with several neurocutaneous syndromes; less frequently, it also involves the brain stem and cerebellum. Traditionally, hemimegalencephaly has been considered a primary neuroblast migratory disturbance. At present, genetic theories of pathogenesis and modern histopathology provide a basis for this complex malformation as a primary disturbance in cellular lineage, differentiation, and proliferation, interacting with a disturbance in gene expression of body symmetry, with earlier onset than radial neuroblast migration. From my personal experience with 10 patients with hemimegalencephaly and review of the literature, I have found the same clinical neurologic, neuroimaging, and neuropathologic features in isolated and syndromic hemimegalencephaly. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reveals abnormal gyration, ventriculomegaly, colpocephaly, an \"occipital sign\" (displacement of the occipital lobe across the midline), and increased volume and T2 signal of white matter, in addition to the overall increased size of the involved hemisphere. Mild, moderate, and severe grades of severity can be recognized, providing a functional neurologic prognosis and therapeutic plan. Early diagnosis is crucial because despite neuroimaging and pathologic evidence, hemimegalencephaly sometimes still is unrecognized. Also, misdiagnosis of obstructive hydrocephalus or cerebral neoplasm can lead to unnecessary surgical procedures. Although hemispherectomy has a high morbidity, it is recommended early for patients with severe, intractable epilepsy. The mildest forms of hemimegalencephaly are infrequent and the least recognized.",

            "abstract": "Genetic mosaicism is the result of the accumulation of somatic mutations in the human genome starting from the first postzygotic cell generation and continuing throughout the whole life of an individual. The rapid development of next-generation and single-cell sequencing technologies is now allowing the study of genetic mosaicism in normal tissues, revealing unprecedented insights into their clonal architecture and physiology. The somatic variant repertoire of an adult human neuron is the result of somatic mutations that accumulate in the brain by different mechanisms and at different rates during development and ageing. Non-pathogenic developmental mutations function as natural barcodes that once identified in deep bulk or single-cell sequencing can be used to retrospectively reconstruct human lineages. This approach has revealed novel insights into the clonal structure of the human brain, which is a mosaic of clones traceable to the early embryo that contribute differentially to the brain and distinct areas of the cortex. Some of the mutations happening during development, however, have a pathogenic effect and can contribute to some epileptic malformations of cortical development and autism spectrum disorder. In this Review, we discuss recent findings in the context of genetic mosaicism and their implications for brain development and disease.",

Therefore, the capability to detect such variants is critical to make genetic diagnosis in MCDs cases. Thanks to recent genomic technical improvements, multiple studies have implicated mTOR pathway brain somatic variants in various MCDs. The present review will show the main current approaches adopted to detect brain somatic variants, the role of mTOR signaling cascade in the pathogenesis of epilepsy with FCD and the therapeutic choices available at this time.",

            "abstract": "Purposes To provide evidence-based quantitative summary estimates of seizure outcomes in patients with non-lesional and lesional epilepsy treated with surgery, and to assess the consistency of results among published studies. Methods An exhaustive literature search identified articles published since 1995, describing outcomes according to lesional status in patients of any age who underwent resective epilepsy surgery. Two reviewers independently assessed study eligibility and extracted the data. Disagreements were resolved through discussion. Random effects meta-analyses were used after assessing the dataset for heterogeneity. Results Forty articles fulfilled eligibility criteria and described outcomes in 697 patients with non-lesional epilepsy and 2860 patients with lesional epilepsy. Overall, the odds of being seizure-free after surgery were 2.5 times higher in patients with lesions on MRI or histopathology (OR 2.5, 95%CI 2.1, 3.0, p<0.001). In patients with temporal lobe epilepsy surgery the odds were 2.7 times higher in those with lesions (OR 2.7, 95%CI 2.1, 3.5, p<0.001). In patients with extratemporal epilepsy surgery the odds were 2.9 higher in those with lesions (OR 2.9, 95%CI 1.6, 5.1, p<0.001). Outcomes were similar in children, adults, and studies that used MRI or histopathology to identify lesions. Discussion Overall, the odds of seizure freedom after surgery are two to three times higher in the presence of a lesion on histopathology or MRI. The results are clinically and statistically significant, consistent across various subgroups, and quite homogeneous across studies.",

            "abstract": "MRI is invaluable in assessing the neonatal brain following suspected perinatal injury. Good quality imaging requires adaptations to both the hardware and the sequences used for adults or older children. The perinatal and postnatal details often predict the pattern of lesions sustained and should be available to aid interpretation of the imaging findings. Perinatal lesions, the pattern of which can predict neurodevelopmental outcome, are at their most obvious on conventional imaging between 1 and 2 weeks from birth. Very early imaging during the first week may be useful to make management decisions in ventilated neonates but brain abnormalities may still be subtle using conventional sequences. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) is very useful for the early identification of ischaemic tissue in the neonatal brain but may underestimate the final extent of injury, particularly basal ganglia and thalamic lesions. MR imaging is an excellent predictor of outcome following perinatal brain injury and can therefore be used as a biomarker in interventional trials designed to reduce injury and improve neurodevelopmental outcome.",

            "abstract": "Imaging is pivotal in the evaluation and management of patients with seizure disorders. Elegant structural neuroimaging with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may assist in determining the etiology of focal epilepsy and demonstrating the anatomical changes associated with seizure activity. The high diagnostic yield of MRI to identify the common pathological findings in individuals with focal seizures including mesial temporal sclerosis, vascular anomalies, low-grade glial neoplasms and malformations of cortical development has been demonstrated. Positron emission tomography (PET) is the most commonly performed interictal functional neuroimaging technique that may reveal a focal hypometabolic region concordant with seizure onset. Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) studies may assist performance of ictal neuroimaging in patients with pharmacoresistant focal epilepsy being considered for neurosurgical treatment. This chapter highlights neuroimaging developments and innovations, and provides a comprehensive overview of the imaging strategies used to improve the care and management of people with epilepsy.",

            "abstract": "Purpose The 2005 diagnostic criteria for Rasmussen encephalitis (RE) are based on seizures, clinical deficits, electroencephalography (EEG), neuroimaging, and pathology (Brain, 128, 2005, 451). We applied these criteria to patients evaluated for RE and epilepsy surgery controls to determine the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values (PPVs, NPVs) using pathology as the gold standard. Methods We identified patients evaluated for RE based on medical records from 1993 to 2011. Fifty-two control patients with refractory epilepsy, unilateral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) changes, and biopsies were selected from an epilepsy surgery database from matching years. Patients meeting all three of group A and/or two of three group B criteria were classified as meeting full criteria (positive). Patients not meeting full criteria were classified as negative. When available, pathology findings were re-reviewed with neuropathologists, and MRI imaging was re-reviewed with a neuroradiologist. Key Findings RE was considered in the differential diagnosis for 82 patients, of whom 35 had biopsies. Twenty patients met full criteria (positive) without another explanation, including seven for whom biopsy was required to meet criteria and one in whom another etiology was identified. Two patients met full criteria but had another explanation. Thirty-five met partial criteria (negative), of whom 14 had another etiology identified. Twenty-five met no criteria (negative). The diagnostic criteria had a sensitivity of 81% with four false negatives (criteria-negative, biopsy-positive) when compared to pathology as a gold standard. Five false positives (criteria positive, biopsy negative) had identifiable alternate diagnoses. Significance The 2005 Bien clinical diagnostic criteria for RE have reasonably high sensitivity and specificity and good clinical-pathologic correlation in most cases. We suggest modification of the criteria to allow inclusion of cases with well-described but less common features. Specifically we suggest making the diagnosis in the absence of epilepsia partialis continua (EPC) or clear progression of focal cortical deficits or MRI findings if biopsy is positive and two of the A criteria are met (B3 plus two of three A criteria). This would improve the sensitivity of the criteria.",

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Ipsilateral loss of anterior temporal gray-white matter definition, due mainly to white matter signal intensity abnormality, is frequently seen on MR images of patients with hippocampal sclerosis. Our aim was to determine the prevalence and clinical correlations of these anterior temporal changes in pediatric cases of hippocampal sclerosis and to determine whether cumulative damage from seizures is important for their development., METHODS: We reviewed the MR images and clinical details of 54 children (age range, 1.5–19 years) with typical hippocampal sclerosis. Specific imaging features noted included hippocampal sclerosis, anterior temporal changes, anterior temporal atrophy, and extra-hippocampal abnormality., RESULTS: Thirty-one (57%) of 54 children with hippocampal sclerosis had associated ipsilateral anterior temporal changes. Ipsilateral anterior temporal atrophy was associated with anterior temporal changes (P < .03). Children whose images showed anterior temporal changes were younger at onset of epilepsy (P < .01) and younger at antecedent cerebral insult (P < .03) than those with normal anterior temporal lobes. Most (84%) children whose images showed anterior temporal changes had experienced the onset of epilepsy or antecedent cerebral insult before the age of 2 years (P < .0009). Eighty-one percent of children with anterior temporal changes shown on their images experienced seizures at the time of antecedent insult., CONCLUSION: Ipsilateral anterior temporal changes identical to those observed in adult cases are seen on the MR images of young children with hippocampal sclerosis, with a similar prevalence, and are associated with either epilepsy onset or seizure-related cerebral insult before the age of 2 years. We suggest that the loss of gray-white matter definition may represent a persistent immature appearance, including an abnormality of myelin or myelination, possibly a result of seizures occurring during maturation of the temporal pole.",

Secondly, to compare neuroimaging techniques (CT, MRI) in the preoperative detection of pathology. Lastly, to examine the surgical outcome in children. <i>Methods:</i> Forty-two pediatric patients undergoing temporal lobectomy for intractable epilepsy at the Comprehensive Epilepsy Program at the University of Alberta Hospital between the years 1988–1998 were studied. Patients had extensive preoperative investigations including CT and MRI. The pathology at surgery was reviewed and compared to preoperative neuroimaging. Charts were reviewed to determine surgical outcome. <i>Results:</i> Brain tumors were the most common pathology, found in 13/42 patients. Mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS) was found in 8 patients and dual pathology in an additional 5. Focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) was seen in 4 patients, 1 patient had a porencephalic cyst and 4 patients had tubers of tuberous sclerosis. Seven patients had no specific pathology detected. MRI was clearly more sensitive than CT in the detection of pathology. MRI was abnormal in 27/42 cases (64%), while CT scan was found to be abnormal in only 12/39 (31%). Surgical outcome was excellent, with 34/42 patients (80%) having an Engel class I outcome. One patient had significant improvement with an Engel class II outcome, 3 (7%) had little improvement (Engel class III) and 4 (10%) were unchanged (Engel class IV). Three patients (7%) had surgical complications. <i>Conclusions:</i> A wide variety of developmental pathology is seen following temporal lobectomy for intractable epilepsy of childhood. Brain tumors, FCD and MTS are common. MRI is superior to CT in the detection of pathology, which may be subtle in children. Surgical outcome is excellent, with most children being seizure free and few complications being seen.",

            "abstract": "A retrospective study was carried out to determine whether a prior cerebral injury or medical illness was associated with hippocampal sclerosis in intractable, surgically treated temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), or whether there was evidence for progressive hippocampal neuron damage from repeated seizures. Temporal lobe epilepsy patients (n = 162) from one epilepsy centre were retrospectively and blindly catalogued into groups based on the presence or absence of an initial precipitating injury (IPI) and whether, when an IPI was present, it had involved seizures (independent variables). Patients were catalogued into four groups: (i) non-seizure IPIs (Group A; n = 54); (ii) IPIs with a prolonged seizure (Group B; n = 66); (iii) IPIs with repetitive non-prolonged seizures (Group C; n = 20); (iv) or no IPIs and idiopathic TLE (Group D; n = 22). The dependent variables were: the differences in the time course of clinical seizures, and quantified hippocampal neuron counts and seizure outcomes. Statistically significant (ANOVA at least P &lt; 0.05) results showed the following. (i) Patients with IPIs (Groups A, B and C) had hippocampal sclerosis, while those with idiopathic TLE (Group D) showed fewer neuron losses and worse post-resection seizure relief.(ii) Patients with non-seizure IPIs (Group A) were on average older at injury; had a longer latent period; showed less neuron losses in Ammon’s horn, CAI and prosubiculum than seizure associated IPIs (Groups B and/or C). (iii) Initial precipitating injury patients with repetitive non-prolonged seizures (Group C) showed the shortest latent period, earliest age of TLE onset, and less CA2 damage than the other IPI groups. Other findings that were statistically significant by analysis of covariance along with the IPI category included the following. (i) CAI (P = 0.0097) and prosubiculum (P = 0.0089) neuron losses were greater in patients when their TLE was longer than 22 years. (ii) IPIs after age 4 years were associated with latent periods shorter than 10 years compared with variable and longer latent periods of IPIs before age 4 years (P = 0.015). These results indicate that in surgically treated TLE, hippocampal sclerosis and good seizure outcomes are associated with IPIs. Most of the hippocampal damage found at surgery and the clinical time course of the habitual TLE are influenced by the pathogenic IPI mechanism. However, some secondary neuron losses were associated with longer TLE seizure histories. This supports the hypothesis that the aetiology of hippocampal sclerosis is an acquired injury to the hippocampus and that the pathogenesis is a combination of acute, subacute, and progressive changes following the initial injury.",

            "abstract": "Objective: To determine whether febrile seizures cause mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS), the occurrence of MTS was evaluated in an unselected series of patients with febrile seizures.Methods: Twenty-four patients with a prolonged first febrile seizure, 8 with an unprovoked seizure after the first febrile seizure, and 32 age-, sex-, and handedness-matched control subjects with a single simple febrile seizure without later unprovoked seizures were selected from 329 febrile seizure patients followed up prospectively. The occurrence of MTS was evaluated after a mean follow-up time of 12.3 years by MR volumetry of amygdala and hippocampal formation and qualitative analysis of mesial temporal structures.Results: None of the patients had MTS. The mean total volumes of the right and left hippocampal formations and amygdala did not differ significantly between any of the three groups. The qualitative analysis revealed no sclerotic changes in the mesial temporal area. The patients with a prolonged initial febrile seizure had a lower mean right–left volume difference in hippocampal formations than the control subjects, but this had no effect on the outcome.Conclusion: The occurrence of MTS following even prolonged febrile seizures is an uncommon event, confirming the good clinical outcome of febrile seizures.",
