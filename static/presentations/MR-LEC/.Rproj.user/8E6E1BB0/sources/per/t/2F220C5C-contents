# WHY is imaging important in epilepsy?

## Reasons for Neuroimaging 

:::{.incremental}
-   establish etiology
-   prognosis
-   identify an acute process, e.g. hydrocephalus, encephalitis
-   subacute or chronic process that requires intervention e.g. tumor, or has other prognostic implications, e.g. leukodystrophy
-   focal lesions may be potentially amenable to epilepsy surgery e.g. MCD
-   understand anatomical relationship to nearby eloquent regions
:::

## Lesional vs Non-lesional epilepsy
::: {.incremental}
- Epilepsy surgery success is directly related to precise localization of EZ [@blume_1986]
- Rate of success in lesional TLE 62-80% vs nonlesional 36% [@berkovic1995]
- Meta-analysis of 40 articles and 697 NL and 2860 LE patients: SZ free odds increased with lesional 2.5 overall, 2.7 temporal and 2.9 extratemporal [@tellez-zenteno2010]

## What is the yield of imaging?

::: {.incremental}
-   New onset seizure and status epilepticus 64/177 children (36%) [@lyons2016]
-   Community-based study in Conneticut of children with new onset epilepsy. 488/613 (79.6%) had imaging. Etiologically relevant findings in 62/488 (12.7%) [@berg2000]
-   Abnormal exam or focal EEG increases odds of finding abnormality

# HOW to perform MRI in patients with epilepsy?

## Recommended protocol

![](bernasconi.png)

::: notes
The Neuroimaging Task Force recommends use of the Harmonized Neuroimaging of Epilepsy Structural Sequences (HARNESS-MRI) protocol with isotropic, millimetric 3D T1 and FLAIR images, and high-resolution 2D submillimetric T2 images
:::

## HARNESS-MRI

![](harness.jpg)
[@bernasconi2019]

::: notes
3D MR images with isotropic voxel resolution and no interslice gap can be reformatted in any plane with equal resolution
3 acquisitions - 
each sequence takes abotu 7-10 minutes
:::

## HARNESS-MRI

# Overview of imaging findings in pediatric epilepsy {.smaller}

## 

-   Malformations of Cortical Development
-   Sequelae of perinatal insult
-   Mesial temporal sclerosis
-   Autoimmune encephalitis & Rasmussen Encephalitis
-   Tumors
-   Vascular malformations
-   CNS infections
-   Neurocutaneous syndromes

# Malformations of Cortical Development

## The human brain is a clonal mosaic

![](brain_clonal.webp)[@bizzotto2022]

::: notes
After fertilization, the zygote divides to reach the eight-cell stage. Sublineages derived from these first eight progenitors of the human embryo differentiate into ectoderm and, subsequently, contribute asymmetrically to the brain, with some lineages contributing more (for example, red clone) and others contributing much less (for example, yellow and pink clones)

## FCD Histology
![](fcd_spectrum.jpeg){height=600px} 
[@najm2022]

::: notes
Staining with neuronal nuclear antibodies (NeuN). B, FCDIa = abundant neuronal microcolumns with often small neurons vertically arrayed like parallel strings of pearls. C, FCDIb of the temporal lobe without any layered neocortical organization. Also note the dramatically thinned cortical diameter. D, FCDIIb of the frontal lobe is characterized by lack of any cortical layering. Instead, large dysmorphic neurons appear randomly placed throughout the cortical ribbon (arrow). Balloon cells are not visible in this NeuN immunohistochemistry. E, FCDIIIa in the temporal neocortex of a patient with hippocampal sclerosis. Note the neuronal cell loss in supragranular layers L2 and L3 (arrow). F, FCDIIIc in a patient with Sturge–Weber syndrome and a vascular malformation (VM), that is, meningeal angiomatosis. The adjacent neocortex is thin and shows abundant microcolumns (as in FCDIa). G, FCDIIId of the parietofrontal region in a patient with perinatal stroke. Note the patchy disruption of cortical layers (arrow). H, FCDIIId of the occipital region in a boy with perinatal hypoxemic injury. Note the loss of layer 4 neurons (arrow). Scale bar = 500 μm, applies to all images
:::

## FCD Imaging - General Features

- blurring of the gray-white matter interface
- signal change on T2-weighted and FLAIR images
  - may indicate presence of balloon cells [@widdess-walsh2006]
- abnormal thickness or gyration/sulcation patterns

## Type 1 FCD {.smaller}
- mild hyperintensity of WM on T2/FLAIR
- loss of GW matter differentiation
- often subtle
- more common in temporal
- may be associated with lobar hypoplasia, atrophy or cortical thickening [@widdess-walsh2006]

## Type 1 FCD

![](fcd1.jpg)
[@widdess-walsh2006]

::: notes
Type 1 FCD: An abnormal gyral pattern with blurring of the gray-white junction is seen in the left occipital region on the T1 volume acquisition sequence (A, arrow). There is also increased FLAIR signal in the mesial aspect of the left occipital region (B, arrow).
:::

## Type 2 FCD {.smaller}
- Range of changes from extremely subtle to obvious
- more common in frontal
- IIa - focal blurring of GW, may have abnormal gyration/sulcation pattern
- IIb - similar to IIa, but often has signal abnormality; can have other signs
- Up to 80% seizure freedom for FCD IIB [@widdess-walsh2005]

## FCD2A

![](fcd2.png)
[@cendes2016]

::: notes
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) multiplanar reconstruction (MPR) in a patient with frontal-lobe seizures due to focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) who had previous MRIs considered as negative. Top row shows reconstructed volumetric coronal T1-weighted images, and bottom row shows reconstructed volumetric fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images and an axial reconstructed T1-weighted image (all with 1-mm thickness). The area with FCD in the left frontal lobe presents with slightly thickened cortex associated with abnormal gyri and cortical dimple (arrows). The FLAIR images did not show a clearly abnormal signal, except for a slightly blurred cortical-subcortical transition. The postoperative histopathology showed classic signs of FCD type IIA.

# Hemimegalencephaly

## Hemimegalencephaly

- rare hamartomatous malformation of the brain with extreme asymmetry
- classification: isolated, syndromic, and total
- syndromic associations: epidermal nevus syndrome, Klippel-Trénaunay-Weber syndrome, Proteus syndrome, Hypomelanosis of Ito, Neurofibromatosis, Tuberous Sclerosis, and others 

## Hemimegalencephaly - Imaging

- increase in the volume of WM, thick cortex with poor gray-white differentiation 
- May have elements of lissencephaly, pachygyria, polymicrogyria, schizencephaly
- corpus callosum is usually asymmetric, but may be hypoplastic or absent


::: notes
isoalted = sporadic without associated body hypertrophy, or cutaneous/systemic involvement; total = there is also enlargement of the ipsilateral half of the brainstem and cerebellum (rarest)

# Other MCD

## Polymicrogyria (PMG)
- excessive small gyri and shallow sulci
- may be associated with other lesions (e.g. callosal agenesis, PVNH)

## Schizencephaly
- cleft which connects the cortical surface with ventricular lumen
- edges are often lined by abnormal cortical tissue
- open lip vs closed-lip (edges are juxtaposed vs not) [@barkovich2012]

## Periventricular nodular heterotopia (PVNH)

- ectopic neurons/gray matter in the periventricular areas (subependymal)


## Subcortical band heterotopia (double cortex)

- band of laminar subcortical 





# Perinatal Insults

## Adult vs Pediatric MTS

- MTS found in only about 1% of children newly diagnosed with epilepsy [@king1998, @berg2000]
- Pediatric temporal lobe epilepsy cases, diagnosed as MTS by MRI - often found to have other pathology after surgery [@sinclair2001]
- Controversy whether febrile seizures cause MTS [@tarkka2003]

# Autoimmune Encephalitis & Rasmussen Encephalitis

## Rasmussen Encephalitis

- Rare, progressive disorder characterized by treatment resistant epilepsy, often with neurologic decline and hemiparesis
- Poorly understood etiology
- MRI shows progressive atrophy of one hemisphere, often worst in opercular region
- Increased signal on T2 and FLAIR

Axial T2-weighted (A), coronal T1-weighted inversion recovery (B), fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), axial (C), and coronal (D) images from two patients with Rasmussen’s encephalitis (A, B and C, D respectively) involving the right hemisphere. The progressive atrophy usually involves initially the insular-opercular regions, as seen in these patients. Sometimes, multiple cortical and subcortical foci of hyperintense FLAIR signal may be present, even in the initial stages of the disease, as in the patient shown in (C) and (D).

## Delalande - Imaging

![](hh_cohen.jpeg)

::: notes

Share
All panels show coronal T2-weighted MRI. HH lesion type is designated according to the proposed classification system of Delalande and Fohlen.44 (A) Type I HH: 2-year-old boy with mild developmental delay but otherwise asymptomatic. Note attachment of the HH lesion entirely below the floor of the third ventricle. (B) Type II HH: 5-year-old boy with a history of gelastic seizures since 12 months of age. Note attachment to the left side of the hypothalamus, entirely above the floor of the third ventricle. (C) Type III HH: 31-year-old woman with refractory epilepsy, including gelastic seizures since infancy. Note attachment of the HH lesion to the right side of the hypothalamus both above and below the floor of the third ventricle. (D) Type IV HH: 3-year-old girl with severe developmental delay, history of precocious puberty, and multiple daily gelastic seizures. Type IV is designated by Delalande and Fohlen as a “giant” HH, but criteria to distinguish between types III and IV were not offered. We (Barrow Neurologic Institute) currently use a volume measurement over 8 cm3 to designate type IV, measuring the maximal length of the lesion in the 3 major axes, then utilizing the formula for determining the volume of an ellipsoid (courtesy of John F. Kerrigan, MD, Barrow Neurologic Institute).
