- Gradient vs spin echo
  - GRE - faster, less susceptible to motion
  - Spin - more robust in signal behavior

# WHY is imaging important in epilepsy?

## Reasons for Neuroimaging

::: incremental
-   establish etiology
-   prognosis
-   identify an acute process, e.g. hydrocephalus, encephalitis
-   subacute or chronic process that requires intervention e.g. tumor, or has other prognostic implications, e.g. leukodystrophy
-   focal lesions may be potentially amenable to epilepsy surgery e.g. MCD
-   understand anatomical relationship to nearby eloquent regions
:::

## Lesional vs Non-lesional epilepsy

::: incremental
-   Epilepsy surgery success is directly related to precise localization of EZ [@blume_1986]
-   Rate of success in lesional TLE 62-80% vs nonlesional 36% [@berkovic1995]
-   Meta-analysis of 40 articles and 697 NL and 2860 LE patients: SZ free odds increased with lesional 2.5 overall, 2.7 temporal and 2.9 extratemporal [@tellez-zenteno2010]

## What is the yield of imaging?

::: incremental

-   New onset seizure and status epilepticus 64/177 children (36%) [@lyons2016]
-   Community-based study in Conneticut of children with new onset epilepsy. 488/613 (79.6%) had imaging. Etiologically relevant findings in 62/488 (12.7%) [@berg2000]
-   Abnormal exam or focal EEG increases odds of finding abnormality

# HOW to perform MRI in patients with epilepsy?

## Recommended protocol

![](bernasconi.png)🇨🇦

::: notes
The Neuroimaging Task Force recommends use of the Harmonized Neuroimaging of Epilepsy Structural Sequences (HARNESS-MRI) protocol with isotropic, millimetric 3D T1 and FLAIR images, and high-resolution 2D submillimetric T2 images
:::

## HARNESS-MRI

![](harness.jpg) [@bernasconi2019]

::: notes
3D MR images with isotropic voxel resolution and no interslice gap can be reformatted in any plane with equal resolution 3 acquisitions - each sequence takes abotu 7-10 minutes

# Overview of imaging findings in pediatric epilepsy {.smaller}

## Overview

-   Malformations of Cortical Development
-   Sequelae of perinatal insult
-   Mesial temporal sclerosis
-   Rasmussen Encephalitis
-   Tumors
-   Neurocutaneous syndromes

::: notes

Impossible to cover all possible topics, there are vascular malformations, infections, rare genetic and neurocutaneous syndromes. The aim is to give you a sampling of important etiologies that you may come across in PMC... 

::: 

# Malformations of Cortical Development

## The human brain is a clonal mosaic

![](brain_clonal.webp)[@bizzotto2022]

::: notes
After fertilization, the zygote divides to reach the eight-cell stage. Sublineages derived from these first eight progenitors of the human embryo differentiate into ectoderm and, subsequently, contribute asymmetrically to the brain, with some lineages contributing more (for example, red clone) and others contributing much less (for example, yellow and pink clones)

## FCD Histology

![](fcd_spectrum.jpeg){height="600px"} [@najm2022]

::: notes
Staining with neuronal nuclear antibodies (NeuN). B, FCDIa = abundant neuronal microcolumns with often small neurons vertically arrayed like parallel strings of pearls. C, FCDIb of the temporal lobe without any layered neocortical organization. Also note the dramatically thinned cortical diameter. D, FCDIIb of the frontal lobe is characterized by lack of any cortical layering. Instead, large dysmorphic neurons appear randomly placed throughout the cortical ribbon (arrow). Balloon cells are not visible in this NeuN immunohistochemistry. E, FCDIIIa in the temporal neocortex of a patient with hippocampal sclerosis. Note the neuronal cell loss in supragranular layers L2 and L3 (arrow). F, FCDIIIc in a patient with Sturge–Weber syndrome and a vascular malformation (VM), that is, meningeal angiomatosis. The adjacent neocortex is thin and shows abundant microcolumns (as in FCDIa). G, FCDIIId of the parietofrontal region in a patient with perinatal stroke. Note the patchy disruption of cortical layers (arrow). H, FCDIIId of the occipital region in a boy with perinatal hypoxemic injury. Note the loss of layer 4 neurons (arrow). Scale bar = 500 μm, applies to all images
:::

## FCD Imaging - General Features

-   blurring of the gray-white matter interface
-   signal change on T2-weighted and FLAIR images
    -   may indicate presence of balloon cells [@widdess-walsh2006]
-   abnormal thickness or gyration/sulcation patterns

# Type 1 FCD

## Type 1 FCD

-   mild hyperintensity of WM on T2/FLAIR
-   loss of GW matter differentiation
-   often subtle
-   more common in temporal
-   may be associated with lobar hypoplasia, atrophy or cortical thickening [@widdess-walsh2006]

## Type 1 FCD

![](fcd1.jpg) [@widdess-walsh2006]

::: notes
at the arrow you can see this abnormal gyral pattern with blurring of the gray-white junctionin the left occipital region on the T1 image (A). There is also increased FLAIR signal in the mesial aspect of the left occipital region (B, arrow).
:::

# Type 2 FCD

## Type 2 FCD

-   Range of changes from extremely subtle to obvious
-   more common in frontal lobe >> parietal/temporal
-   IIa - focal blurring of GW, may have abnormal gyration/sulcation pattern
-   IIb - similar to IIa, but often has signal abnormality; can have other signs
-   Up to 80% seizure freedom for FCD IIB [@widdess-walsh2005]

## FCD2A

::: notes
Patient with frontal epilepsy. Top row shows coronal T1, and bottom row FLAIR and an axial T1. 
L frontal lobe shows slightly thickened cortex associated with abnormal gyri and cortical dimple (arrows). The FLAIR images did not show a clearly abnormal signal, except for a slightly blurred cortical-subcortical transition. The postoperative histopathology showed classic signs of FCD type IIA.

-   Any tumor can present with seizures, but certain types are especially tied to epilepsy: "epilepsy-associated developmental tumors" [@rastogi2008]
-   ganglioglioma, gangliocytoma, desmoplastic infantile ganglioglioma, dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor (DNET), and pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma (PXA)
-   most contain some glial and neuronal component, low proliferation index, only small percentage may undergo malignant transformation
-   may be associated with FCD (i.e. FCD type 3)

## Epilepsy-associated Developmental Tumors

-   Similar imaging characteristics:
-   cortically based
-   hypo- or iso-intense on T1, and hyperintense on T2
-   Commonly have contrast enhancement

# Dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor (DNET)

## Dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor (DNET)

-   much less common than ganglioglioma in children
-   affect mostly temporal \>\> frontal; cortex and extend to WM
-   lesion may be clearly demarcated (50%) or can be blurred
-   calcification in 20-36%
-   usually single- or multi-cystic

## DNET Example

::: notes
(A–C) T1 postgadolinium, T2-weighted coronal and axial fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images showing a dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor (DNT) associated with focal cortical dysplasia (confirmed in the postoperative histopathology) in the right temporal lobe in a 23-year-old patient with refractory partial seizures since the age of 9 years, who became seizure-free after lesionectomy. Note a small area of intratumoral contrast enhancement (A: arrow), and the classic heterogeneous aspect of the tumor in all magnetic resonance imaging (sequences, sometimes given the appearance of small microcysts inside the lesion. (D–F) Coronal T2-weighted and sagittal T1-weighted images showing a DNT in the left temporal lobe in a patient with seizures since childhood who became seizure-free after lesionectomy.

# Ganglioglioma

## Ganglioglioma

-   4% of pediatric CNS tumours [@raybaud.etal2016]
-   40% of epilepsy-associated tumours
-   subtype/differentiation:
    -   WHO grade 1 (pilocytic) astrocytoma, the most common (93%)
    -   WHO grade 2 (fibrillary) astrocytoma, much less common (6%)
    -   Rarely, malignant anaplastic WHO grade 3 (1%) or WHO grade 4 (GBM)
-   Gangliocytoma - purely neuronal variant

## Ganglioglioma Imaging

-   Can present as solid mass (43%), cyst (5%), or mixed lesion (52%) [@koeller2001]
-   Cortically-based, hypo/iso intense to GM and hyperintense on T2

## Ganglioglioma Example

![](gng.jpg)

::: notes
Left temporal lobe ganglioglioma and FCD. LEFT PANEL - Coronal contrast material–enhanced T1weighted MR image shows a cortically based lesion in the left anterior temporal pole with a nonenhancing solid component (arrow) and a cystic component (arrowhead). (b) Coronal T2-weighted MR image shows areas of T2 hyperintensity (arrowheads) surrounding the lesion (arrow), findings that proved to be FCD associated with a ganglioglioma at pathologic analysis. Perilesional edema with ganglioglioma is rare.

## Oligodendroglioma

![](oligo.png) [@cendes2016]

::: notes
Axial fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) (A) and T1-weighted (B) images and postgadolinium coronal T1-weighted image (with a slight peritumoral enhancement (C) in a patient with temporal-lobe epilepsy due to oligodendroglioma in the right temporal horn of the ventricle adjacent to the hippocampus. The area with hypointense signal on FLAIR (arrow) and T1 images corresponds to a small calcification seen on computed tomography scan.
:::

# Pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma (PXA)

## Pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma (PXA)

- rare tumor in children/young adults, highly epileptogenic
- glial > neuronal component
- temporal (49%) > parietal/frontal/occipital[@giannini1999]
- malignant in 20%
- cortically based, classically cystic with enhancement of solid component
- calcification rare, edema uncommon

## Pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma (PXA)

![](pxa.png)
[@raybaud2006]

::: notes

Cortex-centered heterogeneous mass in the L cingulate gyrus w/ mass effect. We see a rim of surrounding edema extending to the corpus callosum (a). The FLAIR imaging shows the central heterogeneity well (b). Contrast administration demonstrates irregular enhancement of the core of the lesion (c). Apart from the cortical location, this appearance is nonspecific
::: 

# Hypothalamic Hemartoma

## Hypothalamic Hemartoma {.smaller}

-   Heterotopic developmental malformation - mixture of normal neurons and glial cells (ventral hypothalamus) [@cohen2021]
-   Clinical:
    -   endocrine (e.g. precocious puberty)
    -   psychiatric (mood, behavior, "rage attacks")
    -   neurological (ID, epilepsy, epileptic encephalopathy)
-   Seizures:
    -   onset usually first year
    -   gelastic, dialetpic, GTC

## Delalande Classification of HH

::: notes
Important because influences clinical presentation. e.g. extend beyond 3rd V have earlier presentation

## Delalande - Imaging

![](hh_cohen.jpeg)

::: notes
Share All panels show coronal T2-weighted MRI. HH lesion type is designated according to the proposed classification system of Delalande and Fohlen.44 (A) Type I HH: 2-year-old boy with mild developmental delay but otherwise asymptomatic. Note attachment of the HH lesion entirely below the floor of the third ventricle. (B) Type II HH: 5-year-old boy with a history of gelastic seizures since 12 months of age. Note attachment to the left side of the hypothalamus, entirely above the floor of the third ventricle. (C) Type III HH: 31-year-old woman with refractory epilepsy, including gelastic seizures since infancy. Note attachment of the HH lesion to the right side of the hypothalamus both above and below the floor of the third ventricle. (D) Type IV HH: 3-year-old girl with severe developmental delay, history of precocious puberty, and multiple daily gelastic seizures. Type IV is designated by Delalande and Fohlen as a “giant” HH, but criteria to distinguish between types III and IV were not offered. We (Barrow Neurologic Institute) currently use a volume measurement over 8 cm3 to designate type IV, measuring the maximal length of the lesion in the 3 major axes, then utilizing the formula for determining the volume of an ellipsoid (courtesy of John F. Kerrigan, MD, Barrow Neurologic Institute).

## Neurocutaneous syndromes

-   Tuberous sclerosis complex
-   Sturge Weber syndrome
-   Less common - hypomelanosis of Ito, epidermal nevus syndrome, Wyburn-Mason syndrome, incontinentia pigmenti

# TSC

## Tuberous Sclerosis Complex
![](tsc-skin.png)
[@li2023a]

## Tuberous Sclerosis Complex {.smaller}

-   Rare monogenic neurocutaneous syndrome due to mutations in *TSC1* or *TSC2*, tumor suppressor genes in the mTOR pathway
-   Abnormalities on brain MRI in \>95% TSC patients[@russo2020]
-   4 major TSC-related manifestations on neuroimaging:

1.  cortical tubers
2.  white matter lesions
3.  sub-ependymal nodules
4.  sub-ependymal giant cell astrocytomas

-   More rarely, can have intra-parenchymal calcifications, hemimegalencephaly, cerebral or cerebellar malformations, intracranial aneurysms and occlusive vascular disorders.

## Subcortical Tubers in TSC {.smaller}

::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
-   Glioneuronal brain hemartomas
-   disrupted 6-layer organization of the cortex
-   usually frontal or parietal but can be spread in all lobes
-   Can be *under-recognized* in first years of life due to similarity with adjacent unmyelinated WM
-   Single or multiple may be dominant epileptogenic trigger

## Different types of cortical tubers

- type A (hyperintense on T2w and isointense on T1w)
- type B (hyperintense on T2w and hypointense on T1w)
- type C (hyperintense on T2w with low signal inner core and heterogeneous halo on FLAIR, hypointense on T1w, with increased diffusion on apparent diffusion coefficient maps)
- with each step higher burden of FCD-like and inflammatory features
- proposed - type D - similar to type C but calcified


::: notes
NOt a clear relationship between tuber type and epileptogenicity. Larger tubers generally more likely to be epileptogenic. Highly individualized per patient
