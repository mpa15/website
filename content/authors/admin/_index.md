Maksim Parfyonov is a Pediatric Epilepsy Fellow at the Cleveland Clinic in Cleveland, Ohio. His research interests include treatment-resistant epilepsy and genetic causes of pediatric epilepsy. 

He currently leads the [EPBiome](https://www.epbiome.com) study , a multi-center trial investigating the role of the gut microbiome in the efficacy of ketogenic diet, which is supported by a grant from the [Weston Foundation](https://www.westonfoundation.org/our-mandate/). His clinical interests mirror his research interests and include treatment-refractory epilepsy, ketogenic diet, and surgical management of epilepsy.
