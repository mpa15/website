Note attachment of the HH lesion entirely below the floor of the third ventricle. (B) Type II HH: 5-year-old boy with a history of gelastic seizures since 12 months of age. Note attachment to the left side of the hypothalamus, entirely above the floor of the third ventricle. (C) Type III HH: 31-year-old woman with refractory epilepsy, including gelastic seizures since infancy. Note attachment of the HH lesion to the right side of the hypothalamus both above and below the floor of the third ventricle. (D) Type IV HH: 3-year-old girl with severe developmental delay, history of precocious puberty, and multiple daily gelastic seizures. Type IV is designated by Delalande and Fohlen as a “giant” HH, but criteria to distinguish between types III and IV were not offered.

Note attachment to the left side of the hypothalamus, entirely above the floor of the third ventricle. (C) Type III HH: 31-year-old woman with refractory epilepsy, including gelastic seizures since infancy. Note attachment of the HH lesion to the right side of the hypothalamus both above and below the floor of the third ventricle. (D) Type IV HH: 3-year-old girl with severe developmental delay, history of precocious puberty, and multiple daily gelastic seizures. Type IV is designated by Delalande and Fohlen as a “giant” HH, but criteria to distinguish between types III and IV were not offered.
